# AGENTS.md

Guidelines for AI coding agents working on this repository. Read this before
writing, moving, or restructuring code. The README documents features in
depth; this file exists to keep new code structurally consistent — previous
contributions broke the architecture by inventing their own layout.

## Stack

- **Bun >= 1.3** — runtime, bundler, and test runner.
- **Hono 4.x** (HTTP). Stable, runtime-agnostic; served via `Bun.serve` with
  `app.fetch` (Bun hands the server to fetch as its 2nd arg → `c.env`).
- **bun:sqlite** — synchronous, zero-ORM. Schema lives in `migrations/`
  (versioned SQL applied at startup, see `migrations.ts`).
- **Inertia v3 + React 19** — in-process SSR; page registry in
  `src/client/pages.ts` with explicit imports.
- **Vanilla CSS, co-located** — no CSS framework. `styles.css` holds only
  global base (tokens, reset, shared UI primitives); component and page
  styles live in sibling `.css` files imported by each `.tsx` (see "CSS"
  below).

## Hard rules

1. **Routes live in `src/server/routes/<feature>.routes.ts`, handlers inline,
   one file per URL.** Route-specific handler logic stays in the route file
   (see `auth.routes.ts`, `uploads.routes.ts`); never create a `routes.ts`
   inside a feature folder. The feature name is derived from the URL, and
   every URL is defined in exactly one file — GET renders and POST actions
   live together (see "Route conventions" below).

2. **`src/server/` is flat except `routes/`. No feature subfolders.**
   Shared or transport-independent logic becomes a single flat module
   (`auth.ts`, `security.ts`, `mailer.ts`, `rate-limit.ts`, `tus-protocol.ts`,
   `tus-storage.ts`). Extract a module only when logic is reused across
   routes or independent of Hono's context — not just to slim a file.

3. **All SQL lives in `db.ts`** as prepared statements created at module
   load (`db.query(...)`). Schema changes are new numbered files
   `migrations/000N_*.sql`; never edit an applied migration. Keep `db.ts`
   a single file — one coherent module reads better than a tree of small
   domain files; reconsider splitting by domain only past ~600–800 lines.

4. **Env is read once, in `config.ts`**, which validates and fails fast.
   Never read `process.env` in other modules. Adding a config key means
   updating `config.ts` and the README env table.

5. **Validation via TypeBox schemas** (`src/server/validation.ts`) at the
   route level; `app.onError` maps `ValidationFailed` to Inertia 422 page
   payloads (`VALIDATION_MESSAGES` in `auth.routes.ts`).

6. **TypeScript**: `strict` + `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` +
   `verbatimModuleSyntax` are on. Type-only imports MUST use `import type`.
   No ORM, no loose `any`; queries are parameterized.

7. **CSS is co-located, not centralised.** `styles.css` holds only global
   base: design tokens (`:root`, `[data-theme]`), reset (`*`, `body`, `h1`…),
   `:focus-visible`, and shared UI primitives used across multiple pages
   (`.btn`, `.badge`, `.panel`, `.table`, `.avatar`). Everything else lives
   in a sibling `.css` file imported by the component or page that uses it
   (`Brand.css`, `Layout.css`, `Dashboard.css`, …). Never add page-specific
   or component-specific rules to `styles.css` — it stays small and global.
   Bun.build bundles all imported `.css` files into one stylesheet via the
   import graph (`app.tsx` → `pages.ts` → page → component → `.css`).

8. **UI work follows the design system — never invents a parallel one.**
   Before creating or editing UI, read `.llm-wiki/wiki/concepts/ui-design-principles.md`
   and `ui-anti-patterns.md`. Reuse tokens from `styles.css` and existing
   components; don't reach for AI-default aesthetics (beige, ghost cards,
   purple gradients, italic serif accents). New components add co-located
   styles per rule 7.

## Route conventions

- **File = URL namespace.** `/posts*` routes live in `routes/posts.routes.ts`
  with page renders and form actions together. Given a URL, the file name
  follows from its first segment — that is the discoverability contract.
- **`pages.routes.ts` is the app shell only** (/, /dashboard, /admin). New
  feature pages do not go there.
- **Infra endpoints** (`/health`, `/assets/*`) stay in `app.ts`, not route
  files.
- **Exports**: `const <feature>Routes = () => new Hono<AppEnv>()...`, mounted
  via `app.route('/', <feature>Routes())` in `app.ts`. Route factories take
  no arguments — the Inertia adapter is a global middleware on the app, not
  per-route state.

## Hono integration notes (do not "fix")

- Middleware runs in registration order; global `app.use()` middleware must
  precede the routes they cover.
- Middleware/guards MUST call `next()` to continue the chain — returning
  `undefined` without `next()` errors with "Context is not finalized".
- Hono converts HEAD → GET (body stripped, headers kept) but `c.req.method`
  still reports "HEAD"; tus `dispatch` relies on this.
- `c.header()`-queued headers are dropped when a handler returns a custom
  `Response` — cookie helpers append to `c.res.headers` instead.
- The `/*` wildcard produces no named param — derive path segments from
  `c.req.path` (see `uploads.routes.ts`).
- `hono/conninfo`'s ESM build is an empty stub in 4.13 — the rate limiter
  reads the peer IP from `c.env` (the Bun server) instead.
- `@sinclair/typebox` does not pre-register string formats — `email` is
  registered in `validation.ts`; add others there.
- The Web `CompressionStream` API is NOT reliably available in every Bun
  1.3.14 context — compression uses `node:zlib` (`compress.ts`), and any
  future code should avoid relying on Web compression globals.

## Testing

- Run **`bun test --isolate`** (or `bun run test`). NEVER plain `bun test`:
  bun 1.3 runs all test files in one shared process, but each suite sets its
  env in `beforeAll` and calls `db.close()` in `afterAll` as if process-
  isolated. Without `--isolate`, one file's teardown finalizes the next
  file's prepared statements and cached `config` values leak across files.
- New test files must set env (`DATABASE_PATH=:memory:`, `UPLOAD_DIR`, …)
  in `beforeAll` BEFORE importing the app module — mirror
  `tests/app.test.ts` and `tests/tus.test.ts`.
- Suite must stay green: run `bun run typecheck` and
  `bun run test` before finishing. `tsc` only covers `src/` and `scripts/`.


## Browser testing

- When testing in the browser, ALWAYS open the browser console (DevTools →
  Console) and check for errors/warnings. Client-side runtime errors
  (failed imports, React runtime errors, hydration mismatches, bad Inertia
  props, network 4xx/5xx on XHR) do NOT show up in `bun run typecheck` or
  the build — the build compiles, the page renders, and the bug is silent
  until you read the console. A green build + green tests does NOT mean the
  page works; the console is the source of truth for client-side failures.
- Use the `browser` tool (`xd://browser`) to drive a real tab and read
  `console` output, or screenshot DevTools. Do not declare a UI change
  verified without having read the console for the page you changed.

## Style

- Match the repo's current style: 2-space indent, double quotes, semicolons
  (normalized by the editor/agent formatter; `tests/` and the route files are
  the reference). When editing an existing file, match that file's
  formatting.
- Keep changes minimal and conventional; delete dead code rather than
  leaving shims or aliases behind a rename.
